<h3>Manager, ML Modeling, iRobot — 2018 -</h3>
<p>I was internally recruited to develop the marquee feature of next-gen robots. My team's focus is on: </p>
<p>
    <label for="mn-figure-1" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="mn-figure-1" class="margin-toggle">
    <span class="marginnote">
    - **Team Scale:** varied at irobot from 4-12 (including contractors and interns), current position 8 (50% PhD's)
    - **Growth:** centeralized all ML into one org. Recurited my boss (DDean), actively asked my team to be reduced to improve focus. The ML team now is 25+ members.
</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>ML Research &amp; Development</strong> of embedded robot Deep Learning models that:  <ul>
<li>run embedded using TensorFlow Lite with &lt;1% error in <em>millions</em> of homes. </li>
<li>are <em>reproducibly</em> trained using Docker and KubeFlow Pipelines. The modular pipelines support both <em>research</em> &amp; <em>production</em> workflows.  </li>
<li>use the latest training techniques including Population Based Training, Active Learning and Semi-supervised pre-training. </li>
</ul>
</li>

    - responsible for almost all ML Vision patents in the last couple of years.
    - help direct iRobot investments and partnerships in 
        1. _Synthetic Data_ 
        2. _Augmented Reality_  (including minor effort with Apple)
        3. long-erm partnership with Google Cloud AI (eg. NAS, PBT, AutoML, explainability, TensorFlow Lite steering team)
</p>

<p>As the team leader I focus on: </p>
<ul>
<li><em>Product strategy</em> developing ML product roadmaps that meet PM, UX and cost constraints. </li>
<li><em>Scientific leadership</em> help my team review and build on latest DL/ML literature.</li>
<li><em>Software architecture</em> selecting the right tools and vendors to support our data pipeline and training needs. </li>
<li><em>Team growth</em> Our team grew from a couple of interns to a team of 25+. I Interviewed 100's of candidates and worked with HR to enhance our team's <em>diversity</em>. </li>

    **Focus Areas**:   
</p>

<h3>Principle Data Scientist, iRobot — 2017-2018</h3>
<ul>
<li>Developed data science models that distilled the data streaming from millions of robots to actionable intelligence used by everyone in the company (from executives down to rank-and-file engineers). </li>
<li>Research to support cutting-edge digital robot user experiences focused on machine learning and augmented reality. Built The minimal viable products that were used to to prove out concepts and solidify product roadmaps.</li>
<li>Hire, mentor, collaborate with and managed teams to support the above three focus areas.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Lead Instructor, General Assembly &amp; Professional Speaker at No Fluff Just Stuff Conferences — 2015-</h3>
<p>Taught DS/ML programs and professional conference workshops that vary in length from a single day to multiple months. Topics include machine learning methods, visualization, Big Data, software architecture &amp; other related approaches.</p>
<h3>Data Scientist &amp; Software Architect, EnerNOC, — 2014-2016</h3>
<ul>
<li>Researched different methods of modeling and projecting energy data and time-series (25 provisional &amp; issued patents).</li>
<li>Managed and participated in academic collaborations with WPI, MIT and Harvard in the areas of energy and machine learning software Architecture.</li>
<li>I designed and built multiple IoT time-series processing engines to for  energy analytics products. These systems consumed  TBs/day in a near realtime using Apache Spark and AWS Lambda. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Automation Tech Lead/Sr. Software Engineer, Vecna, — 2011-2014</h3>
<ul>
<li>Designed &amp; wrote base testing service using standard tools (Selenium, AWS, Docker, Jenkins).</li>

<li><em>Languages:</em> Wolfram, Clojure/ClojureScript, Java, Python and Scala (in that order) </li>
<li><em>Cloud and distributed systems</em>: I've been using linux since 0.96, and used it to build big and small systems on anything from hand-built HPC clusters to large scale AWS and GCP deployments. Most recently, I have been using Kubeflow Pipelines to train and validate ML models at the scale of 10's of millions of images.</li>
</ul>
