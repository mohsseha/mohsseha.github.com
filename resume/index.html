</ul>
<h2>Recent Work History</h2>
<h3>Director, Machine Learning, Symbotic - 2021 -</h3>
<p>As a Director of Machine Learning my focus has been mostly on preception and vision this year. Major accomplishments: </p>
<ul>
<li>Designed a number of preception system that will allow the bots preceive case poses at sub mm accuacy and at a failure rate of less than 1 in a million. </li>
<li>Architected a light-weight containerized ML deployment arhictecture that would allow: <ul>
<li>Rapid deployment-feedback-interation cycles. </li>
<li>Validation of Models in the cloud, the build system and on the bots using almost identical tooling</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Lead a team of 14 ML Engineers, Scientist and technicans.</li>
</ul>

<p>I was internally recruited to develop the marquee feature of next-gen robots. My team's focus is on: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>ML Research &amp; Development</strong> of robot embedded CNN models that:  <ul>
<li>are optimized for detection, localization and embedding.</li>
<li>have &lt;1% error in <em>millions</em> of homes globally.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Scalable Data collection processes and infrastructure</strong> with: <ul>
<li>~10^8 labeled and unlabeled images.</li>
<li>guaranteed user privacy exceeding GDPR requirements.</li>
<li><em>cost effective</em> real image labeling and synthetic data generation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Corporate ML technology support:</strong> <ul>
<li>Supported iRobot Ventures in making investment decisions in 10's of companies globally.</li>
<li>IP/patent production (details below).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As the team leader I focus on: </p>
<ul>
<li><em>Product strategy</em> developing ML product roadmaps that meet PM, UX and cost constraints. </li>
<li><em>Scientific leadership</em> help my team review and build on latest DL/ML literature.</li>
<li><em>Software architecture</em> selecting the right tools and vendors to support our data pipeline and training needs. </li>
<li><em>Team growth</em> grew the teams from a couple of interns to a team of 25+ full timers. I Interviewed 100's of candidates and worked with HR to substantially improve amd enhance our diversity and inclusion process. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Principle Data Scientist, iRobot — 2017-2018</h3>
<ul>
<li>Developed data science models that distilled the data streaming from millions of robots to actionable intelligence used everywhere from rank-and-file engineers to executives. </li>
<li>Led research to support cutting-edge digital robot user experiences focused on machine learning and augmented reality. Built The minimal viable products that were used to to prove out concepts and solidify product roadmaps.</li>
<li>Hired, mentored, and sometimes managed teams to support the above three focus areas.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Lead Instructor, General Assembly &amp; Professional Speaker at No Fluff Just Stuff Conferences — 2015-</h3>
<p>Taught DS/ML programs and professional conference workshops that vary in length from a single day to multiple months. Topics include ML methods, visualization, Big Data, software architecture, etc.</p>
<h3>Data Scientist &amp; Software Architect, EnerNOC, — 2014-2016</h3>
<ul>
<li>Researched different methods of modeling and projecting energy data and time-series (25 provisional &amp; issued patents).</li>
<li>Managed and participated in academic collaborations with WPI, MIT and Harvard in the areas of energy and machine learning software Architecture.</li>
<li>I designed and built multiple IoT time-series processing engines to for  energy analytics products. These systems consumed  TBs/day in a near realtime using Apache Spark and AWS Lambda. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Automation Tech Lead/Sr. Software Engineer, Vecna, — 2011-2014</h3>
<ul>
<li>Designed &amp; wrote base testing service using standard tools (Selenium, AWS, Docker, Jenkins).</li>
<li>Hired and trained a team of 4 engineers to introduce company-wade automation.</li>
<li>I was the sole maintainer and dev ops engineer for the GoalMind product. GoalMind was a <strong>250k</strong> LOC internal Java/JavaScript web-app that managed finances, time-keeping and planning for Vecna and it's VA customers spanning 1000’s of hospitals that serve millions of patients.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Tools</h2>
<p>I have evaluated, used and taught many tools over the years, some of my favorites: </p>
<ul>
<li><em>Machine Learning &amp; Data Science:</em> TensorFlow, CoreML, Apache Spark and Kubeflow Pipelines.</li>
<li><em>Languages:</em> Wolfram, Clojure/ClojureScript, Java, Python and Scala snd others. </li>
<li><em>Cloud and distributed systems</em>: I've been using linux since 0.96, and used it to build big and small systems on anything from hand-built HPC clusters to large scale AWS and GCP deployments. Most recently, I have been using Kubeflow Pipelines to train and validate ML models at the scale of 10's of millions of images.</li>
</ul>
